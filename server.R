        time by age, and the age at which someone is first exposed to a drug. 
        These visualizations allow healthcare providers to more easily explain 
        how and when drug use occurs in a given location to their clients to 
        target potential misconceptions about drug usage. This might guide 
        providers as to where more information about drugs is most relevant.
